# C# Algorithms and Data Structures

**The problem when programming is** Believing that you are just solving the problem and running is enough; if it gives me the correct result, I already fulfilled as a programmer.

A **data structure** is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so **that it can be used efficiently**. In general, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms.

An **algorithm** is a set of instructions or rules defined and ordered that allows, typically, **to solve a problem**.
